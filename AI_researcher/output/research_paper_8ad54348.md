## Methods

## Methods
\label{sec:methods

### Data Collection
\label{subsec:data-collection

The data collection process involved gathering relevant information from various sources. 
We utilized a combination of automated tools and manual curation to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data. 
The data was collected using *Python scripts and *APIs from multiple databases.

### Knowledge Graph Creation
\label{subsec:knowledge-graph-creation

The collected data was then used to create a knowledge graph, which was constructed using the *Neo4j graph database. 
We employed the *GraphCypher query language to define the structure and relationships within the graph. 
The knowledge graph was created by extracting entities, relationships, and concepts from the collected data.

### Query Answering Process
\label{subsec:query-answering-process

The query answering process involved formulating and executing queries on the knowledge graph. 
We used the *Cypher query language to retrieve relevant information from the graph. 
The queries were executed using the *Neo4j query engine, and the results were post-processed using *Python scripts.

### Tools and Techniques
\label{subsec:tools-and-techniques

The methods section employed several tools and techniques, including:
\begin{itemize
    \item *Python programming language for data collection and post-processing
    \item *Neo4j graph database for knowledge graph creation and query execution
    \item *Cypher query language for querying the knowledge graph
    \item *GraphCypher query language for defining the knowledge graph structure
    \item *APIs for data collection
\end{itemize
