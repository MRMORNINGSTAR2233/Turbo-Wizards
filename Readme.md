</p>

## üåü Overview

Searchify is an advanced research automation platform that transforms complex research queries into comprehensive, well-structured research papers. The system leverages a distributed multi-agent architecture to mine data, build knowledge graphs, answer research questions, and generate professional documents‚Äîall with minimal human intervention.

## üöÄ What Problem Does It Solve?

Academic and professional research is often time-consuming and resource-intensive, requiring:
- Extensive data collection from diverse sources
- Complex knowledge organization and synthesis
- Critical analysis and structured reporting
- Professional document creation with proper citations

Searchify automates this entire process, allowing researchers, students, and professionals to:
- Get comprehensive research on any topic in minutes instead of days or weeks
- Access information from various sources through a unified interface
- Generate publication-ready documents with proper structure and citations
- Focus on insights and creative work rather than tedious research tasks

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Multi-Source Data Mining**: Collects information from academic papers, reddit, medium, and other platforms
- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Creates a structured representation of entities and relationships
- **LiteRAG Technology**: Generates focused answers to research questions with context awareness
- **Professional Document Generation**: Creates LaTeX-based research papers with proper formatting
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple UI for submitting research queries and viewing results

## üíª Technical Architecture

The system is built with a modern stack divided into three main components:

### Frontend
- NextJs with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS & Acerteneity UI and ShadCN for styling
- Next Router for navigation

### Backend
- FastAPI (Python) for the RESTful API
- SQLAlchemy for database operations
- Alembic for database migrations

### AI Research Engine
- Custom multi-agent system with specialized roles (Data Miner, Knowledge Graph, LiteRAG, Writer)
- Streamlit interface for direct interaction with the research pipeline
- Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Groq, Anthropic, OpenRouter)
