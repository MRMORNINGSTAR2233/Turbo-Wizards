<h2>Methods</h2>
<p><h2>Methods</h2>
\label{sec:methods</h2></p><p><h3>Data Collection</h2>
\label{subsec:data-collection</h2></p><p>The data collection process involved gathering relevant information from various sources. 
We utilized a combination of automated tools and manual curation to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data. 
The data was collected using <em>Python</h2> scripts and <em>APIs</h2> from multiple databases.</p><p><h3>Knowledge Graph Creation</h2>
\label{subsec:knowledge-graph-creation</h2></p><p>The collected data was then used to create a knowledge graph, which was constructed using the <em>Neo4j</h2> graph database. 
We employed the <em>GraphCypher</h2> query language to define the structure and relationships within the graph. 
The knowledge graph was created by extracting entities, relationships, and concepts from the collected data.</p><p><h3>Query Answering Process</h2>
\label{subsec:query-answering-process</h2></p><p>The query answering process involved formulating and executing queries on the knowledge graph. 
We used the <em>Cypher</h2> query language to retrieve relevant information from the graph. 
The queries were executed using the <em>Neo4j</h2> query engine, and the results were post-processed using <em>Python</h2> scripts.</p><p><h3>Tools and Techniques</h2>
\label{subsec:tools-and-techniques</h2></p><p>The methods section employed several tools and techniques, including:
\begin{itemize</h2>
    \item <em>Python</h2> programming language for data collection and post-processing
    \item <em>Neo4j</h2> graph database for knowledge graph creation and query execution
    \item <em>Cypher</h2> query language for querying the knowledge graph
    \item <em>GraphCypher</h2> query language for defining the knowledge graph structure
    \item <em>APIs</h2> for data collection
\end{itemize</h2></p>
